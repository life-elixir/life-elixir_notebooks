Life Elixir Notebooks
=====================
These notebooks are [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) for
testing different parts of Life Elixir. These tests serve a somewhat different
purpose than the unit test suite installed as a part of Life Elixir. Instead
of being small isolated (unit) tests, these notebooks are often more like
integration tests, which exercise a more significant part of the Life Elixir codebase to make
sure that different parts work together as expected, or tests that exercise
various related parts in a module in a single location.

To open these files, start an IPython notebook server by running the following
command in the directory that contains the files:

    $ jupyter notebook
    
or, if you have an old version of IPython installed:
    
    $ ipython notebook
    
This will open a new page in your web browser, showing the IPython notebook
dashboard page with an index of all the notebooks.

# Online read-only versions

You can also view the notebooks online, as read-only HTML pages rendered by
http://nbviewer.ipython.org. The notebooks are rendered also by My Binder. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/life-elixir/life-elixir_notebooks/HEAD).

# Tutorials and lectures

The notebooks are organized with tutorials and lectures on [index.ipynb](index.ipynb).

# Contribute

You are most welcome to contribute to the Life Elixir notebooks by forking this.
repository and send pull requests or filing bug reports at the
[issues page](https://github.com/life-elixir/life-elixir_notebooks/issues), or send us bug reports,
questions, or your proposed changes to our products
